    "Transforming the data: In this technique, we apply a mathematical \n",

    "\n",
    "Robust methods: In this technique, we use statistical methods that are \n",
    "less sensitive to outliers, such as the median instead of the mean, or \n",
    "non-parametric methods such as random forests or support vector machines.\n",

    "with the mode of the available data, while hot-deck imputation uses values from similar\n",

    "Multiple imputation: In this technique, we generate several imputed datasets using a\n",
